tonyhax with a boot CD
======================

A standalone burned CD which contains tonyhax.

Why?
----

Since this CD requires a chipped console, you might be thinking: "wasn't the point of tonyhax to not rely on a modchip?". Well, yes.

However, as of v1.4, even if you have a modded console, tonyhax is kind of useful to:
 * Automatically patch games that have antipiracy
 * Use imported games in later European consoles which check the disc's region

Installation
------------

Just burn the BIN/CUE inside the `boot-cd/` folder on a CD-R, insert it on your modded console, and turn it on. Easy peasy!
